Lexical Structure
================================

The lexical structure of a programming language details what the individual words and symbols used in the language must look like. Things like strings, numbers, quotation literals, and word names are included under this specification, as well as the important tokens that *separate* them.

Character Set
--------------------------------

Wort files may be written using the Unicode character set. Implementations of the language must support Unicode 3 at the minimum, or any later version. This goes for string literals as well as identifiers in the language.

Wort is also case sensitive. For instance, the words ``dup``, ``Dup``, and ``DUP`` are all considered distinct. As such, primitive functions must be typed in a Wort file *exactly* as they appear in the reference manual. ``if`` is a keyword, but ``If`` is not.

Whitespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whitespace is an essential part of any Wort file. All lexical tokens must be separated by at least one whitespace character in Wort. However, strict indentation and formatting as found in Python, for example, are not necessary for Wort, and you can utilize as much whitespace as you see fit. An exception to this occurs in string literals, which may not span multiple lines.

Wort recognizes several code points as whitespace. The most common one is ``\u{20}``, the regular space character, but also included are ``\u{9}``, the tab; ``\u{B}``, the vertical tab; ``\u{C}``, the form feed; ``\u{A0}``, the non-breaking space; ``\u{FEFF}``, the non-breaking space; and any code point in the Zs category. This is the same subset of characters recognized as spaces in JavaScript.

Wort treats the usual line break characters as whitespace, since they add nothing to the language syntax. For purposes of debugging in the Wort transpiler, however, the line feed character ``\u{A}`` is treated separately and tracks the line number. Other common line break characters are treated only as whitespace; these include ``\u{D}``, the carriage return; ``\u{2028}``, the line separator; and ``\u{2029}``, the paragraph separtor.

Normalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All implementations of are required to normalized string literals with escaped code points. However, it is still possible to construct strings which are not normalized internally (using various character code functions). Wort does not care whether word names are normalized or not, but may normalized words as different that non-normalized ones depending on the implementation.

Comments
--------------------------------

Wort only supports single line comments, beginning with a ``#`` and running until the end of the line. All comments are ignored by the Wort transpiler.

Literals
--------------------------------

Literals are any collection or value that appear directly in the source code of a Wort program::

    null        # the null value
    13          # the number 13
    3.14        # the number 3.14
    'hodor'     # a string of text
    true        # a boolean literal
    [ 1 2 3 ]   # a quotation literal
    { a : 2 }   # an object literal with one field

Full details on the proper representations for these literals is given for each in their respective sections. However, a key point that will be introduced now, to motivate some thinking about the ideas behind Wort, is that all literals can be treated as a *function* which push the value they name onto the stack. Though a firm understanding of this point is not necessary for being able to use the language, it does help to illustrate the *homoiconicity* of Wort. For more of the theory behind concatenative programming, search for the Joy language on the web.

Identifiers
--------------------------------

Identifiers can be thought of as names. The use of such names is very restricted in Wort; identifiers may only name words, external modules, or the fields of objects. As mentioned in the introduction, there are no variables or classes in Wort.

A Wort identifier must begin with a letter (this may also be a Unicode letter), a dash ``-``, or a question mark ``?``. Wort identifiers can be any length, and any character after the first may be a letter, a digit, a dash, or a question mark. The following are legal identifiers:

    hodor
    why?
    -what-is-this-
    ????

Note that `-` and `--` are not legal identifiers, as they denote the subtraction operator and the decrement operator respectively. Also note that word names which begin with a dash are treated differently from those that don't: names which begin with a dash are considered *private* functions, whereas names which begin with any other valid character are considered *public*. This will be covered later in the modules section.

Operators and Primitives
--------------------------------

Wort specifies several primitive words. Due to the nature of Wort, which relies on a few basic principles, these primitives are treated no different from user defined words. The ``if`` word, for instance, is actually just a word instead of a separate syntax, and can be analyzed as any other word in Wort. However, Wort does not allow user defined functions to use a name that is used by a primitive, and hence these are called *reserved words*. The entire list of reserved words is as follows::

    zap
    swap
    cat
    clone
    cons
    dup
    uncons
    unit
    i
    x
    dip
    neg
    to-number
    to-boolean
    to-string
    typeof
    null?
    typeof?
    quotation?
    string?
    boolean?
    number?
    object?
    word?
    empty?
    in?
    has?
    where?
    similar?
    slice
    slice-from
    cut
    insert
    splice
    reverse
    sort
    case
    branch
    when
    if
    cond
    while
    linrec
    tailrec
    genrec
    step
    fold
    map
    times
    filter
    split
    cleave
    spread
    apply
    annihilate
    gather
    substitute
    print
    printz
    print-stack

Wort also has a set of primitive operators, which are treated just like words but are often made up of symbols which can't be used in the names of regular words. The operation specified by most of these operators might be intuitive, but a full description of the operators and their semantics occurs later in the docs. For now, here is the entire list of operators included in Wort::

    +   -   *   /   %   ++  --      # arithmetic operators
    ~   &   |   ^   <<  >>  >>>     # bitwise operators
    &&  ||  !                       # logical operators
    ==  !=  <   <=  >   >=          # comparison operators
    ->  <-  @                       # property access operators
